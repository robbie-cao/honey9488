	How to use the Audio features with SAI peripheral

	Example Description

This example provides basic implementation of audio features.
It allows to play an audio file through the SAI peripheral and using the external
codec implemented on the STM324x9I_EVAL board.

In this example the SAI input clock, provided by a dedicated PLL (PLLI2S),  is
configured to have an audio sampling frequency at 48 KHz.

This example uses an audio codec driver which consists of three independent layers:
 - Codec Hardware layer: which controls and communicates with the audio codec
   (WM8994) implemented on the evaluation board.
 - MAL (Media Access Layer): which controls and interfaces with storage media
   storing or providing the audio file/stream.
 - The high layer: which implements overall control and interfacing API allowing
   to perform basic audio operations (Init, Play, Pause, Resume, Stop, Volume
   control and audio file pointer management)

In this example the audio file is stored in the internal flash memory (Stereo,
16-bit, 48 KHz). The analog output device is automatically detected (Speaker or
Headphone) when the Headphone is plugged/unplugged in/from the audio jack of the
evaluation board. The example also manages information display and control interface
through push buttons:
 - When the application is Playing audio file:
     + Key   : Volume UP
     + Wakeup: Volume DOWN

This example plays the audio file stored in internal flash memory and replay it
when it reach end of file. But it can be tailored to used different media storage
devices; SDCard (through SDIO), external Memory (through FMC) ...) or to play
in streaming mode (ie. from USB port in device or host mode). In this case, Circular
DMA mode should be preferred (by enabling the define AUDIO_MAL_MODE_CIRCULAR in
stm324x9i_eval_audio_codec.h file).

The WM8994 codec support the TDM format, for this the SAI peripheral is configured
with 4 time slot (2 time slots left/right channels for headphone and 2 time slots left/right
channels for speaker).
in the WM8994 configuration the SLOT0 (2 time slots left/right) is dedicated for
the headphone and SLOT1 (2 time slots left/right) is dedicated for speaker and
the user can choose to configure the 2 audio stream in the same time or one stream
 by output (speaker/headphone) by enabling the following defines SAI_CODEC_SLOT0_1,
 SAI_CODEC_SLOT0 or SAI_CODEC_SLOT1.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs only on STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL(STM32F429x/439x Devices)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - STM324x9I_EVAL Workspace :
    - Add the files "stm324x9i_eval_audio_codec.c" to the project source list this file
      is located under Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
