	Context Swapping during Digest calculation example

	Example Description

This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to
save and restore hash context to serve a high priority hash operation.

For this example, no DMA is used for data transfer.
The SHA-1 and MD5 digests can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the USART.

- In the first step the MD5 and SHA1 digests are computed and displayed.
- In the second step, a TIM6 interruption is configured to occurs with frequency of
  280 KHz and a MD5 digest calculation is launched.
  During the TIM6 interrupt routine, the current MD5 context is saved, then a SHA-1
  digest calculation is launched (a high priority hash operation) and a counter is
  incremented (ContextSwapCounter).
  When the SHA1 digest calculation is done, the saved MD5 context is restored and
  the MD5 digest calculation is continued.
  When the MD5 digest calculation is done, both MD5 and SHA1 digests are displayed
  to show that there is no difference between the results of the first and the
  second steps.

	HASH SHA-224 and SHA-256 with DMA

	Example Description

This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to
hash data using SHA-224 and SHA-256 Algorithms.

For this example, DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the HASH processor.
The message to hash must be multiple of 512-bit (64 bytes) so the message must
be padded to multiple of 64 bytes. In this example, the message to hash is
2048-bit (256 bytes) data.
The SHA-224 message digest result is a 224-bit data (28 bytes = 7 words) available
in H0...H6 registers.
The SHA-256 message digest result is a 256-bit data (32 bytes = 8 words) available
in H0...H7 registers.

The SHA-224 and SHA-256 digests can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the
USART.
