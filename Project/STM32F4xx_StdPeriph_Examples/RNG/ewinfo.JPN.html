	Multiple Random Number Generator

	Example Description

This example provides a short description of how to use the RNG peripheral to
generate Random 32bit numbers.

For this example, an interactive human interface is developed to allow user to
display 8 (arbitrary value, which can be updated by user) random 32bit numbers
using the eval board LCD and/or USART with PC HyperTerminal, using PRINT_ON_LCD
and PRINT_ON_USART defines in main.h

After startup, user is asked to press key button.
The 8 Random 32bit numbers are displayed as soon as the key is pressed.

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled


	Directory contents

  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/system_stm32f4xx.c   STM32F4xx system clock configuration file
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/stm32f4xx_conf.h     Library Configuration file
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/stm32f4xx_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/stm32f4xx_it.c       Interrupt handlers

  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/main.h               Main header

 note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls"
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com">ST Website</a>


	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x,
    STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) and STM324x9I-EVAL
    (STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
       note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2

  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector
      CN8 (USART1) and PC serial port.
       note Make sure that jumper JP7 is in position 1-2

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None


	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
