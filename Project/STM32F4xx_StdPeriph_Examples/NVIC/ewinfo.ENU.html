	NVIC IRQ Channels Mask example

	Example Description

  This example demonstrates the use of the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
  (NVIC) IRQ Channels configuration and how to mask/activate different IRQs:

  - Configuration of 3 timers (TIM2..TIM4) to generate an interrupt on each counter
    update event.

  - The three timers are linked to their correspondent Update IRQ channel.

  - Assignment of an ascendant IRQ priority for each IRQ channel :
     - TIM2 has a preemption priority of 0
     - TIM3 has a preemption priority of 1
     - TIM4 has a preemption priority of 2

  - In each interrupt routine:
     - TIM2 toggles a LED1 each 1s
     - TIM3 toggles a LED2 each 2s
     - TIM4 toggles a LED3 each 3s

  - The KEY/WAKEUP (Wakeup for STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices) and Tamper buttons
    are used to boost the execution priority as follows:

    - The KEY/WAKEUP button is used in GPIO mode and at each KEY/WAKEUP button
      press, the execution priority is raised to 0 and turn LED4 ON. This prevents
      all exceptions with configurable priority from activating, other than through
      the Hard Fault fault escalation mechanism. As consequence, all LEDs stop toggling
      as TIM2, TIM3 and TIM4 IRQs are prevented from activation.

      Pressing again the KEY/WAKEUP button will release the priority boosting, turn
      LED4 OFF and will allow all exceptions with configurable priority to be activated
      and TIM2, TIM3 and TIM4 can be generated again and the LEDs restart toggling.

      This execution priority is made using the CMSIS functions "__disable_irq()"
      and "__enable_irq()".
      These two functions are managing the Cortex-M4 PRIMASK special register.

    - The TAMPER button is used in EXTI mode and at each TAMPER button press, the
      execution priority is masked to 0x40 using the BASEPRI register.
      A non-zero value will act as a priority mask, affecting the execution priority
      when the priority defined by BASEPRI is the same or higher than the current
      executing priority.
      As consequence, LED2 and LED3 stop toggling as TIM3 and TIM4 IRQs are
      prevented from activation.
      Pressing again the TAMPER button will configure the BASEPRI register to 0,
      thus it has no effect on the current priority and TIM3 and TIM4 can be
      generated again and LED2 and LED3 restart toggling.

      This execution priority is made using the CMSIS functions "__set_BASEPRI()".
      This function is managing the Cortex-M4 BASEPRI special register.
      Setting the BASEPRI register has no effect when the execution priority is
      raised to 0 using the "__disable_irq()" function.

 note These mechanisms only affect the group priority. They have no effect on
      the sub-priority. The sub-priority is only used to sort pending exception
      priorities, and does not affect active exceptions.

	NVIC IRQ Priority example

	Example Description

  This example demonstrates the use of the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC):

  - Configuration of 2 EXTI Lines (WAKEUP button EXTI Line &amp; KEY/Tamper button EXTI
    Line) to generate an interrupt on each falling edge and use the SysTick interrupt.
  - These interrupts are configured with the following parameters:
    - WAKEUP button EXTI Line:
      - Preemption Priority = ubPreemptionPriorityValue
      - SubPriority = 0
    - KEY/Tamper button EXTI Line:
      - Preemption Priority = 0
      - SubPriority = 1
    - SysTick Handler:
      - Preemption Priority = !ubPreemptionPriorityValue
      - SubPriority = 0

  First, the "ubPreemptionPriorityValue" is equal to 0, the WAKEUP button EXTI Line
  has higher preemption priority than the SysTick handler.

  In the KEY/Tamper button EXTI Line interrupt routine the WAKEUP button EXTI Line and
  SysTick preemption priorities are inverted.
  In the WAKEUP button EXTI Line interrupt routine, the pending bit of the SysTick
  interrupt is set. This will cause SysTick ISR to preempt the WAKEUP button EXTI
  Line ISR only if it has higher preemption priority.

  The system behaves as following:

  1) The first time KEY/Tamper button EXTI Line interrupt occurs, the SysTick preemption
  becomes higher than WAKEUP button EXTI Line one. So when the WAKEUP button EXTI
  Line interrupt occurs, the SysTick ISR is executed and the "ubPreemptionOccured"
  variable become TRUE and the four leds (LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4) start toggling.

  2) When the next KEY/Tamper button EXTI Line interrupt occurs, the SysTick preemption
  becomes lower than WAKEUP button EXTI Line one. So when the WAKEUP button EXTI
  Line interrupt occurs, the "ubPreemptionOccured" variable became FALSE and the four
  leds (LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4) stop toggling.

  Then this behavior is repeated from point 1) in an infinite loop.

	NVIC Vector Table Relocation example

	Example Description

  This example describes how to relocate the CortexM4 vector table in a specific
  address other than the default Flash memory base address.
  This can be used to build program which will be loaded into Flash memory by an
  application previously programmed from the Flash memory base address.
  Such application can be In-Application Programming (IAP) through USART, Ethernet
  or USB (Device Firmware Upgrade, DFU).
  These applications are available for download from the ST microcontrollers
  website: <a href="http://www.st.com">ST Website</a>

  To build such application, some special configurations have to be performed:
  1. Set the application load address, using your toolchain linker file
  2. In the application code, relocate the vector table at the application load
     address using the "NVIC_SetVectorTable" function from the misc.h/.c driver or
     by modifying the value of the constant "VECT_TAB_OFFSET" defined in "system_stm32f4xx.c"
     file.

  For example, when building an application to be loaded with the IAP through USART
  the application load address and vector table address must be set to 0x08004000.

  In this example, the associated program implements a "Delay" function based on
  SysTick end of count interrupt, and toggles four leds with timing defined by the
  "Delay" function.

	NVIC DMA in WFI mode example

	Example Description

  This example shows how to enter the system to WFI mode with DMA transfer enabled
  and wake-up from this mode by the DMA End of Transfer interrupt.

  In the associated software, the system clock is set to 168 MHz, the DMA1 Stream1
  channel4 is configured to transfer 10 data from the EVAL_COM1 (USART3 for
  STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx and STM32F427x/STM32F437x devices, and USART1 for
  STM32F429x/STM32F439x devices) data register to a predefined buffer "DST_Buffer",
  and to generate an interrupt at the end of the transfer. The EVAL_COM1 (USART3/1)
  receives data from Hyperterminal.
  LED1 is toggled with a frequency depending on the system clock, this is used
  to indicate whether the MCU is in WFI or RUN mode.

  Pressing Tamper/key push button (generates rising edge on EXTI Line15/13) will
  put the core in the WFI mode, causing the LED1 to stop toggling.
  To wake-up from WFI mode you have to send the sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
  from the Hyperterminal to the EVAL_COM1 (USART3/1). These bytes will be transferred
  by the DMA from the EVAL_COM1 (USART3/1) receive data register to the predefined
  buffer, then generates an interrupt which exits the system from WFI mode.
  The LED1 restarts toggling and a LED2 will toggle if the buffer is correctly
  received else a LED3 is toggled.
