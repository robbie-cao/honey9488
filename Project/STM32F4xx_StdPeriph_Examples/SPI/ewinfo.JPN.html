	SPI FLASH

	Example Description

This example provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library
and an associated driver "spi_flash.c" to communicate with an M25P64 SPI FLASH.

The first step consist in reading the SPI Flash ID. A comparison between the ID
read from SPI flash and the expected one is done and LED1 is turned on in case
of success otherwise LED2 is turned on.

Using this driver the program performs an erase of the sector to be accessed, a
write of a Tx_Buffer, defined in the main.c file, to the memory followed by a read
of the written data. Then data read from the memory stored in the Rx_Buffer are
compared with the expected values of the Tx_Buffer. The result of this comparison
is stored in the "TransferStatus1" variable.

A second erase of the same sector is done at the end, and a test is done to be
sure that all the data written there are erased further to the sector erase. All
the data location are read and checked with 0xFF value. The result of this test
is stored in "TransferStatus2" variable which is FAILED in case of error.

The FLASH_WRITE_ADDRESS and the FLASH_READ_ADDRESS where the program start the
write and the read operations are defined in the main.c file.

	SPI Communication Boards Data Exchange using DMA

	Example Description

This example provides a small application in which joystick buttons are used
to trigger SPI communication using DMA and though using SPI firmware
library.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them
BoardA and BoardB) then connect these two boards through SPI lines and GND.
In the firmware example uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file to use
the SPI peripheral as STM32 Master device or as STM32 Slave .

 note The connection between the pins should use a short wires and a common Ground.

- Software Description
In master board, SPI peripheral is configured as Master full duplex with DMA,
whereas in Slave board, SPI peripheral is configured as Slave Full duplex with DMA.

At the end of the data transfer, a data consistency check will be performed
in master and slave sides. In case of mismatch between sent and received data,
LED2 and LED4 are OFF. Otherwise LED1 and LED3 are ON.

In both boards, the data transfers is managed using SPIx_IRQHandler in stm32f4xx_it.c
file.
The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle LD1 each 100ms indicating that the
firmware is running.
These operations can be repeated infinitely.


A defined communication timeout is insuring that the application will not remain
stuck if the SPI communication is corrupted.
You can adjust this timeout through the USER_TIMEOUT define inside main.h file
depending on CPU frequency and application conditions (interrupts routines,
number of data to transfer, baudrate, CPU frequency...).
When a given operation is not finished within the defined timeout, a callback is
made to the function "TimeOut_UserCallback()", this function is used to manage
timeout communication failure. In this example, this callback implements a simple
infinite loop, but user can add his own implementation to manage timeout failure.
