	DAC Signals generation example

	Example Description

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to
generate several signals using DMA controller.
When the user presses the KEY push-button, DMA transfers the two selected
waveforms to the DAC.
For each press on KEY button, 2 signals has been selected and can be monitored on
the two DAC channels:
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1) and Sine waveForm (Channel 2).
    - Noise waveform (Channel 1) and Triangle waveform (Channel 2).


	Directory contents

  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/stm32f4xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/stm32f4xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/stm32f4xx_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/main.c              Main program
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/main.h              Main program header file
  - DAC/DAC_SignalsGeneration/system_stm32f4xx.c  STM32F4xx system source file

 note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls"
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com">ST Website</a>


	Hardware and Software environment
  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
     - Use KEY push-button connected to PG15.
     - Connect PA4 (DAC Channel1) and PA5 (DAC Channel2) pins to an oscilloscope.
     - Make sure that JP31 is removed.


	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
