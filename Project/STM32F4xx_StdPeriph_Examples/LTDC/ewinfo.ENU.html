	LTDC example

	Example Description

  This example describes how to display on LCD an animated picture saved under
  microSD.

  The animated picture is the display of a sequence of images with a determined
  frequency to be seen like one animated image.

  The user has to copy the two directories "/BACK" and "/TOP" available with this
  project under the micro SD card root.

  * Background picture display
  ----------------------------
  Once the LCD, SD card and file system are initialized and configured, a check
  of the existence and the content of the "/BACK" directory is done.

  * Foreground animated pictures display
  -------------------------------------
  A content check of the "/TOP" directory is done and the number of ".BMP" files
  is retained.

 note : The maximum number of BMP file is fixed at 25. It can be raised
        until reaching the maximum of SD card memory space.

  The following steps are performed to scroll all the images stored in the
  SD Card :

  - The foreground layer is set, the image copied from SD card (from "/TOP" directory)
    to intermediate SDRAM memory space and then copied to LCD frame buffer.

  - The color keying feature is applied to remove the bottom of foreground layer (transparent)
    and then replaced by the background layer.

  - Jump to next image

 note :
  => If the "/Foreground" directory is empty, a warning message is displayed on the LCD :
     "  No Bitmap files...  "

  => If the file type stored in the "/BACK" or "/TOP" directories is not supported,
     a warning message is displayed on the LCD : " file type not supported. "

  => If the SD card is not inserted, a warning message is displayed on the LCD :
     " Please insert SD Card. "

 note :
  This example can be tested with AMPIRE480x272 (MB1046), then make sure that the defined
  variable in associate LCD eval driver is "define USE_LCD_AM480272"

	LTDC Color Keying example

	Example Description

 This example describe how to enable and use the color keying functionality.

 After LCD initialization, LCD layer 1 and color keying configuration, an image
 is displayed on LCD.
 Color keying is enabled/disabled on the image when the tamper button is pressed.

 Color Keying :
 --------------
 If the Color Keying is enabled, all pixels are compared to the color key.
 If they match the programmed RGB value, all channels (ARGB) of that pixel
 are set to 0.

  Each LCD device has its specific synchronous timings values.
  This example uses AM480272H3TMQW-T01H LCD (MB1046 Rev.A) and configures
  the synchronous timings as following :

  Horizontal Synchronization (Hsync) = 41
  Horizontal Back Porch (HBP)        = 2
  Active Width                       = 480
  Horizontal Front Porch (HFP)       = 2

  Vertical Synchronization (Vsync)   = 10
  Vertical Back Porch (VBP)          = 2
  Active Heigh                       = 272
  Vertical Front Porch (VFP)         = 2

  LCD_TFT windowing configuration :
  ---------------------------------

  To configure the active display window, this example configures the
  horizontal/vertical start and stop.

  HorizontalStart = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP);
  HorizontalStop  = (Offset_X + Hsync + HBP + Window_Width - 1);
  VarticalStart   = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP);
  VerticalStop    = (Offset_Y + Vsync + VBP + Window_Heigh - 1);

  Window_width and Window_heigh should be in line with the image size to be
  displayed.

	LTDC Display 2 layers example

	Example Description

  This example describes how to configure the LTDC peripheral to display two Layers
  at the same time.
  The goal of this example is to explain how to blend two layers and how to display
  an image with L8 (8bits per pixels indexed) as pixel format.

  After LCD initialization, the LCD layer 1 and Layer 2 are configured as following :
  - Layer 1 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with direct
    color (RGB565) as pixel format and 320x240 size.
  - Layer 2 is configured to display an image loaded from flash memory with indirect
    color (L8) as pixel format and 320x240 size.
    To display an image with an indirect color as pixel format a color lookup table (CLUT)
    is loaded, then every byte from image data (L8_320x240) is considered as
    a position in color lookup table (CLUT).(see example below)

  The blending is always active and the two layers can be blended following
  the configured blending factors and the constant alpha.
  In this example the constant alpha for layer 2 is decreased to see the layer 1
  in the intersection zone.

  Example :
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |Image data   |  position   CLUT(RGB Value)  |   Alpha  | Output (ARGB value)|
  |-------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------- |

	LTDC example

	Example Description

  This example describes how to display on LCD pictures saved under SD card.

  The user has to copy the directory all pictures from "PICTURES" directory
  available with this project under a dedicated directory named as "PICT" in
  the micro SD card root.

 note : The user can add pictures of his choice but the file type, resolution
        and pixel format described below must be respected.

  Once the LCD, SD card and file systems are initialized and configured,
  a content check of the "PICT" directory is done and the number of ".BMP" files
  is retained.

 note : An associate LCD eval driver is used in this example

 note : The maximum number of BMP file is fixed at 25. It can be raised
        until reaching the maximum of SD card memory space.

  The following steps are performed to scroll all the images stored in the
  SD Card :

  Step1 :
  ------
  The foreground layer is set, the image copied from SD card to intermediate
  SDRAM memory and then copied to LCD frame buffer. The image is fully visible when
  the level of transparency is increased until it becomes totally opaque (reaches 255).

  Press tamper button to display next image.

  Step2 :
  ------
  When the Tamper button is pressed the transparency of the foreground layer
  begins to decrease until become totally transparent and the background layer
  is set, the image copied from SD card to intermediate SDRAM memory and then
  copied to LCD frame buffer and finally the level of transparency of the
  background layer increase until it reaches 255 (totally opaque).

  Press tamper button to display next image.

  Step3 :
  ------
  When the Tamper button is pressed the transparency of the background layer
  begins to decrease until become totally transparent and return to step1.


 note
  => If the "PICT" directory is empty, a warning message is displayed on
     the LCD : "  No Bitmap files...  "

  => If the file type stored in the "PICT" directory is not supported,
     a warning message is displayed on the LCD : " file type not supported. "

  => If the SD card is not inserted, a warning message is displayed on the LCD :
     " Please insert SD Card. "

  This example can be tested with AMPIRE640x480 or with AMPIRE480x272 then
  to choice between the two device change the defined variable in associate LCD
  eval driver : "#define USE_LCD_AM640480" or "#define USE_LCD_AM480272"

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32439I-EVAL (STM32F429x/
    STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    supported device and development board.


	How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - The bitmap images should be copied inside a dedicated directory named as "PICT"
    at the micro SD card root.
    The images should have the following properties:
     file type    : *.bmp
     resolution   : up to 480x272 with AM480272H3TMQW LCD and up to 640x480 with
                    AM-640480G5TNQW-T00H LCD
     pixel format : RGB565, RGB888 or ARGB8888
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
  - Add the following files in the project source list :
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_sdio_sd.c
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_ioe16.c
    - Utilities\Third_Party\fat_fs\src\ff.c
  - Add the include path of the directory : Utilities\Third_Party\fat_fs\inc
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
