	FMC NOR flash memory basic functionalities use example

	Example Description

  This basic example shows how to perform erase/read/write operations on the M29W128GL
  NOR memory mounted on the STM324x9I-EVAL board. It uses an associate driver developed
  to interface with the indicated NOR flash memory device.

  The example follows a set of NOR operations in order to write and verify a data
  buffer to the NOR external memory. For more details about NOR commands interface
  and functionalities, refer to the NOR memory datasheet.

  After correctly reading the manufacturer and device IDs, the program returns to
  NOR read mode and erases the block where the write/read start data exists. A data
  buffer of half words is written to the memory. Finally, the data written is read
  back to check its correctness.

  The user can chose his own configuration by commenting/uncommenting the defines for
  undesired/desired configurations in the memory associate driver's header file,
  for example, to enable Continuous clock feature, uncomment the define for the
  configuration "FMC_CClock_SyncAsync" in "stm324x9i_eval_fmc_nor.h" file.

  If the data is read correctly, the LED1 is on, otherwise the LED2 is on.

	FMC SDRAM memory basic functionalities use example

	Example Description

  This example shows how to configure the FMC to drive the MT48LC2M3B2B5-7E SDRAM
  memory mounted on STM324x9I-EVAL evaluation board.

  The goal of this example is to expalin the different fields of the FMC structure,
  and how to initialize the FMC SDRAM without using an associate driver for the
  memory device.

  In this example, the FMC SDRAM bank is configured and initialized explicitly
  following all initialization sequence steps. After initializing the device, user
  can perform read/write operations on it. A data buffer is written to the SDRAM
  memory, then read back and checked to verify its correctness.

  The user can chose his own configuration by commenting/uncommenting the defines for
  undesired/desired configurations in "main.h", for example, to enable Read Burst
  feature, uncomment the define for the configuration "FMC_Read_Burst_Enable".

  If the data is read correctly from SDRAM, the LED1 is on, otherwise the LED2 is on.

 note - The FMC mode register definition is configured using defines for the external
        memory device mode register, defined in the main header file.
      - The function "Delay()" is used to have a delay measured of microseconds.

	Example Description

  This example shows how to use the MT48LC2M3B2B5-7E SDRAM mounted on STM324x9I-EVAL
  as dta memory (including heap and stack).

  The example scenario does not reflect a real application case, its purpose is to
  provide only the procedure to follow to use the external SDRAM as data memory.

  This example does not use the default library startup file. It uses a modified
  startup file provided with the example. While startup, the SDRAM memory is
  configured and initialized to be ready to contain data.

  The user has to configure his preferred toolchain using the provided linker file.
  The RAM zone is modified in order to use the external memory as a RAM.

	FMC Perform read/write operations using DMA burst transactions

	Example Description

  This example shows how to configure the FMC and DMA to perform DMA read/write
  transfer operations on the MT48LC2M3B2B5-7E SDRAM memory mounted on STM324x9I-EVAL
  board.

  This example gives an application of how to configure the DMA as master to perform
  memory to memory burst transfer to read/write data from/to the SDRAM memory.

  In a first step, the DMA is configured to write data to SDRAM memory with fixed
  burst length access and data width. The end of transfer is handled by DMA stream
  IRQ handler. The second step is to configure the DMA in order to read the written
  data from SDRAM and check data correctness.

  Before running this example, a specific configuration has to be set: in the SDRAM
  associate eval driver, uncomment the defines to enable "Read Burst" feature and
  "32 bit data width" in "stm324x9i_eval_fmc_sdram.h" file, used for the memory transfer.
  The DMA burst transfer is considerably useful when data unit is more than one byte.

  The LEDs are configured to indicate the example status:
  - LED1 on : correct data transfer (PASS).
  - LED2 on : incorrect data transfer (FAIL).
  - LED3 on : DMA transfer complete.

	FMC SDRAM memory low power mode use (self refresh mode)

	Example Description

  This example shows how to configure the FMC to drive the MT48LC2M3B2B5-7E SDRAM
  memory in low power mode (self refresh mode) mounted on STM324x9I-EVAL board.

  In this example, a simple application of the FMC SDRAM low power mode (self
  refresh mode) hile the MCU is in a low power mode (STOP mode).

  The purpose is to allow the SDRAM to retain data written after entering STOP mode.
  STOP mode is a CPU low power mode which stops all clocks in the 1.2 V domain, only
  internal SRAM and registers content are preserved.

  After initialization, the data is written to the SDRAM memory before sending
  a self refresh command to it. Once the data is written, the CPU enters in STOP
  mode and LED3 is turned on. The wakeup from STOP mode is done when pushing wakeup
  Button and the CPU returns to RUN mode. At this time, the system clock is reconfigured.
  Finally, a normal mode command is send to SDRAM memory to exit self refresh mode.
  The data written to SDRAM is read back and checked.

  LED3 are used to indicate the system state as following:
  - LED3 On  : CPU enters STOP mode.
  - LED3 off : the CPU is in RUN mode.
  - LED1 on  : correct data transfer (PASS).
  - LED2 on  : incorrect data transfer (FAIL).

	How to switch from SDRAM to SRAM memory bank

  This example shows how to switch from the SDRAM bank to the SRAM bank and access
  both memories mounted on STM324x9I-EVAL board.

  After writing data to the SDRAM memory, a precharge all (PALL) command issued
  to the SDRAM to put its internal banks in idle state. Once the SDRAM bank is
  precharged and the SRAM is initialized, the SRAM memory can be accessed with
  read/write operations.

  If the data is read correctly from both SDRAM and SRAM, the LED1 is on, otherwise
  the LED2 is on.

	FMC SRAM memory basic functionalities use example

	Example Description

  This example shows how to configure the FMC to drive the SRAM memory mounted
  on STM3240_41_G_EVAL or STM32437I_EVAL or STM324x9I_EVAL board. It uses an
  associate driver developed to interface with the indicated SRAM device.

  After initializing the device, user can perform read/write operations on it.
  A data buffer is written to the SRAM memory, then read back and checked to verify
  its correctness.

  To enable the continuous clock feature feature, the burst access mode must be
  also enabled in the used FMC SRAM bank. The continuous clock will be automatically
  enabled in the FMC SRAM bank 1.

  The user can chose his own configuration by commenting/uncommenting the defines
  for undesired/desired configurations in the memory associate driver's header file,
  for example, to enable the continuous clock feature, uncomment the define for
  the configuration "FMC_CClock_SyncAsync".

  If the data is read correctly from SRAM, the LED1 is on, otherwise the LED2 is on.

	FMC SRAM DataMemory example

	Example Description

  This example shows how to use the SRAM mounted on on STM3240_41_G_EVAL or STM32437I_EVAL
  or STM324x9I_EVAL board as program data memory (including heap and stack).

  The example scenario does not reflect a real application case; its purpose is to
  provide only the procedure to follow to use the external SRAM as data memory.

  This example does not use the default library startup file. It uses a modified
  startup file provided with the example. While startup, the SRAM memory is configured
  and initialized to be ready to contain data.

  The user have to configure his preferred toolchain using the provided linker file.
  The RAM zone is modified in order to use the external memory as a RAM.

	Directory contents

	How to use it ?

 In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following file in the project source list:
   - STM324xG_EVAL:
