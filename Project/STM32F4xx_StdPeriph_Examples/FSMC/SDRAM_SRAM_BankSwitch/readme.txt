@par Example Description 

  This example shows how to switch from the SDRAM bank to the SRAM bank and access 
  both memories mounted on STM324x9I-EVAL board.
  
  After writing data to the SDRAM memory, a precharge all (PALL) command issued 
  to the SDRAM to put its internal banks in idle state. Once the SDRAM bank is 
  precharged and the SRAM is initialized, the SRAM memory can be accessed with 
  read/write operations.
  
  If the data is read correctly from both SDRAM and SRAM, the LED1 is on, otherwise 
  the LED2 is on. 
 
@note  
  In order to run the project, the following files have to be added in the toolchain 
  browser:
  - utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_fmc_sdram.c
  - utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_fmc_sram.c

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices. 
   
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL (STM32F429x/ 
    STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

 In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following file in the project source list
   - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_fmc_sram.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
