	FLASH Program

	Example Description

This example provides a description of how to program the FLASH memory integrated
within STM32F40xx/41xx, STM32F427x/437x and STM32F429x/439x Devices.

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. To unlock it,
the FLASH_Unlock function is used.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using
the flash erase sector feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of sector to be used. Then all these sectors will be erased one by one.

Once this operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed using
the word programming function. The written data is then checked (read the
content of memory and compare it to the expected data).
If all the data are correct, the LED1 is on, otherwise the LED2 is on.

 note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls"

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x and STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL, STM32437I-EVAL
    and STM324x9I-EVAL evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other
    supported device and development board.


	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

	FLASH Write Protection

	Example Description

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for FLASH integrated within STM32F40xx/41xx, STM32F427x/437x and STM32F429x/439x Devices.

By maintaining the Key push-button pressed at Reset, the program will check the
write protection status of FLASH_WRP_SECTORS (defined in main.c)
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are write protected, the write protection will be disabled.
    Then LED1 will turn ON, if the protection disable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED3 turns ON.
  - If FLASH_WRP_SECTORS are not write protected, the write protection will be enabled.
    Then LED4 will turn ON, if the protection enable operation is done correctly,
    otherwise LED3 turns ON.

If after reset the Key push-button is not pressed, the program will simply turn ON LED2.
