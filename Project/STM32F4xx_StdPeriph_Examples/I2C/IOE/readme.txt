@par Example Description 

  This firmware provides an example of configuring and using the IO Expander STMPE1600 
  STMPE811 in order to control input Joystick IOs, output IOs and the Touch Screen 
  feature. This example provides the elementary steps to control the following modules 
  and use them in an application:
  The IO pins are used for:
    - Getting Joystick pins status (Polling and interrupt).
    - The Touch Screen controller is used to get the Touched area detection information
      in a single point mode (Polling and interrupt).
    
  The input information can be used either in Polling mode (uncomment the define
  #define IOE_POLLING_MODE) or in Interrupt mode (uncomment the define #define
  IOE_INTERRUPT_MODE). These defines are in main.h file.

  After configuring the IO Expander modules and Interrupts (if needed), the output
  IOs are set to their default state. If the IO Expander is not operational (or the 
  I2C pins are not in the correct level), a message is displayed on the LCD screen.

  To get the status of an input:
    - Dedicated function is used for Joystick which returns a JOY_State_TypeDef
      value indicating the currently pressed key. This information is used to update 
      the LCD display (the Joystick pressed key name is displayed).
    - Dedicated function is used for Touch Screen which returns a pointer to 
      a structure holding the Touch Screen status (did a Touch Detection happened, 
      X, Y, and Z positions). Only detection into the drawn rectangles areas is 
      considered and used to update the LEDs status and LCD display (corresponding  
      LED turned ON when its rectangle is touched, and the LED name is displayed on
      the LCD screen).

  Besides, the example checks the status of the other Push-Buttons implemented on
  the board (Tamper/Key and WakeUp push-buttons). They are checked in parallel 
  with the IO Expander IOs and the LCD display and LEDs are updated according to 
  the push buttons state.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices. 
   
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL (STM32F429x/ 
    STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following file in the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_ioe16.c 
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x9I_EVAL\stm324x9i_eval_ioe8.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
