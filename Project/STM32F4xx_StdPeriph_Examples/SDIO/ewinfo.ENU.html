	How to use the SDIO to drive an SD card memory

	Example Description

  This example provides a basic application of how to use the SDIO firmware library
  and an associate driver to perform read/write operations on the SD Card memory
  (SD Card V1.0, V1.1, V2.0 and SDHC (High Capacity) protocol)that could be mounted
  on the STM324xG_EVAL/STM32437I_EVAL board.

  The example provides different SD Card transfer states and operations.
  Below a description of each step:

   - First the SDIO peripheral and SD Card are initialized using the "SD_Init()"
     function:
            - Configure the SDIO according to the desired SDIO_CK clock frequency.
            - Reset the SD Card.
            - Identify the SD Card.
            - Initialize the SD Card.
            - Get the SD Card Information.
            - Select the SD Card.
            - Enable the Wide Bus mode (4-bit data).

   - SD Card Erase Operation
            - Start an Erase operation: Erase the corresponding blocks using
              the "SD_Erase()" function.
            - Read the Erased blocks using the "SD_ReadMultiBlocks()" function.
            - Test if the corresponding Blocks are well erased: check if the
              EraseStatus variable is equal to PASSED. If the erase operation is
              passed LED1 is turned ON.

   - SD Card Single Block Operation
            - Start a Write operation: Write a single Block using the "SD_WriteBlock()"
              function
            - Read a single Block using the "SD_ReadBlock()" function
            - Compare the written Block and the read one: check if the TransferStatus1
              variable is equal to PASSED. If the Single Block Read/write operation
              is passed LED2 is turned ON.

   - SD Card Multiple Block Operation
            - Start a Multiple Write operation: Write a multi Blocks using the
              "SD_WriteMultiBlocks()" function.
            - Read a multiple Blocks using the "SD_ReadMultiBlocks()" function
            - Compare the written Blocks and the read one: check if the TransferStatus2
              variable is equal to PASSED. If the Multiple Blocks Read/Write operation
              is passed LED3 is turned ON.

  All data transfers are made by DMA.
  At each operation, the SD Card presence and status is checked using the "SD_GetStatus()"
  function and a global variable "Status" storing the results of the last operation.

  SD Card Operations and Written/Read data correctness is signaled  by LED
  lightening and though as follow:
   - If the Erase operation is PASSED then LED1 ON else the LED4 is ON and LED1
     is OFF
   - If the Single Block Write/Read operation is PASSED then LED2 ON else the LED4
     is ON and LED2 is OFF
   - If the Multi Blocks Write/Read operation is PASSED then LED3 ON else the LED4
     is ON and LED3 is OFF
   - Any SD Card operation including the SD Initialization error is signaled by
     LED4 ON.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development
    board.

	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the "stm324xg_eval_sdio_sd.c/stm324x7i_eval_sdio_sd.c" file
   (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM3240_41_G_EVAL
          Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL)
    to the project source list
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
