	IWDG Example

	Example Description

  This example shows how to update at regular period the IWDG reload counter and
  how to simulate a software fault generating an MCU IWDG reset on expiry of a
  programmed time period.

  The IWDG timeout is set to 250 ms (the timeout may vary due to LSI frequency
  dispersion).

  First, the TIM5 timer is configured to measure the LSI frequency as the
  LSI is internally connected to TIM5 CH4, in order to adjust the IWDG clock.

  The LSI measurement using the TIM5 is described below:
   - Configure the TIM5 to remap internally the TIM5 CH4 Input Capture to the LSI
     clock output.
   - Enable the TIM5 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
     period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
     its real value.

  Then, the IWDG reload counter is configured as below to obtain 250 ms according
  to the measured LSI frequency after setting the prescaler value:

       IWDG counter clock Frequency = LSI Frequency / Prescaler value

  The IWDG reload counter is refreshed each 240 ms in the main program infinite
  loop to prevent a IWDG reset.

  LED2 is also toggled each 240 ms indicating that the program is running.

  An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
  on the rising edge of the signal.

  The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event
  occurs, by pressing the Key/Tamper push-button, the corresponding interrupt is
  served. In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception
  containing an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the IWDG
  reload counter is not refreshed).
  As a result, when the IWDG counter reaches 00h, the IWDG reset occurs.

  If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED1 turns on.
  If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
  in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x,
    STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) and STM324x9I-EVAL
    (STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any
    other supported device and development board.


  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PG.06 and PG.08 pins.
    - Use the KEY push button connected to PG.15 pin (EXTI Line15).

  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 leds connected respectively to PG.06 and PG.07 pins.
    - Use the Tamper/KEY push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
