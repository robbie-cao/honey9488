	CortexM4 BitBand example

	Example Description

This example shows how to use CortexM4 Bit-Band access to perform atomic
read-modify-write and read operations on a variable in SRAM.

	Directory contents

  - CortexM/BitBand/stm32f4xx_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - CortexM/BitBand/stm32f4xx_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - CortexM/BitBand/stm32f4xx_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - CortexM/BitBand/main.c              Main program
  - CortexM/BitBand/system_stm32f4xx.c  STM32F4xx system source file

 note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls"
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com">ST Website</a>

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development
    board.

	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

	CortexM4 Mode Privilege example

	Example Description

This example shows how to modify CortexM4 Thread mode privilege access and stack.
CortexM4 Thread mode is entered on Reset, and can be entered as a result of an
exception return.

The associated program is used to:

1. Switch the Thread mode stack from Main stack to Process stack

2. Switch the Thread mode from Privileged to Unprivileged

3. Switch the Thread mode from Unprivileged back to Privileged

To monitor the stack used and the privileged or unprivileged access level of code
in Thread mode, a set of variables is available within the program. It is also
possible to use the 'Cortex register' window of the debugger.

	CortexM4 MPU example

	Example Description

This example presents the MPU features on STM32F4xx devices and it can be easily
ported to any other STM32 device supporting MPU.

The example purpose is to configure a memory region as privileged read only region
and tries to perform read and write operation in different mode.

If the access is permitted LED1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted,
a memory management fault is generated and LED2 is ON.
To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, uncomment
the following line "PrivilegedReadOnlyArray[0] = 'e';" in the "stm32_mpu.c" file.
