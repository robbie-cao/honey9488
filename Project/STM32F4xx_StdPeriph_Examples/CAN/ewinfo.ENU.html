	CAN LoopBack example

	Example Description

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 175 Kbps. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful.

User can select CAN1 or CAN2 cell using the defines in main.h :

#define USE_CAN1
/* #define USE_CAN2*/

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PG.06 and PG.08 pins


	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

	CAN Networking example

	Example Description

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive
CAN frames in normal mode. The sent frames are used to control Leds by pressing
key push button.

The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - After reset LED1 is ON
  - By Pressing on KEY Button : LED2 turns ON and all other Leds are OFF, on the N
    eval boards connected to the bus.
  - Press on KEY Button again to send CAN Frame to command LEDn+1 ON, all other Leds
    are OFF on the N eval boards.

 note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
 note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing KEY button)
      or receiver.

	The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
		- ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
		- RTR = Data
		- DLC = 1 byte
		- Data: Led number that should be turned ON

User can select CAN1 or CAN2 cell using the defines in main.h :

#define USE_CAN1
/* #define USE_CAN2*/

    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins
    - Use KEY Push Button connected to PG15
    - Connect a female/female CAN cable between at least 2 EVAL CAN connectors (CN10)
    - Depending on the CAN cell used, you have to configure the jumpers as follows:

       +-----------------------------------------------+
       |   Jumper    |    CAN1 used    |    CAN2 used  |
       +-----------------------------------------------+
       |   JP3       |       2-3       |       1-2     |
       |   JP10      |       2-3       |       1-2     |
       |   JP7       |       1-2       |       1-2     |
