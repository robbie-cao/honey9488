	RCC example

	Example Description

  This example shows how to use, for debug purpose, the RCC firmware to retrieve
  the current status and frequencies of different on chip clocks.
  You can see the "RCC_ClockFreq" structure content, which hold the frequencies of
  different on chip clocks, using your toolchain debugger.

  This example handles also the High Speed External clock (HSE) failure detection:
  when the HSE clock disappears (broken or disconnected external Quartz); HSE, PLL
  are disabled (but no change on PLL config), HSI selected as system clock source
  and an interrupt (NMI) is generated. In the NMI ISR, the HSE, HSE ready interrupts
  are enabled, and once HSE clock recovers, the HSERDY interrupt is generated and in
  the RCC ISR routine the system clock is reconfigured to its previous state (before
  HSE clock failure). You can monitor the HSE clock on MCO1 pin(PA8).

  Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

 note On the STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL/STM324x9I-EVAL boards, to genertate the
      HSE failure you can remove the HSE quartz from the socket.

 note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration.
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls"

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x,
    STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) and STM324x9I-EVAL
    (STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any
    other supported device and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins

  - STM324x7I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins

  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.07, PG.10
      and PG.12 pins


	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
