	GPIO IO Toggle example

	Example Description

  GPIO ports are connected on AHB bus, using BSRRH and BSRRL registers, one cycle
  is required to set a pin and another cycle to reset it. So GPIO pins can toggle
  at AHB clock divided by 2.

  This example describes how to use BSRRH and BSRRL (Port Bit Set/Reset Register
  High and Low) for maximum IO toggling.

  PG6 and PG8 (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop:
  - Set PG6 and PG8 by setting corresponding bits in BSRRL register
  - Reset PG6 and PG8 by setting corresponding bits in BSRRH register

  In this example, HCLK is configured at 168 MHz so PG6 and PG8 toggle at 84MHz.
  To achieve the maximum IO toggling frequency, you have to configure your compiler
  options for high speed optimization.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x,
    STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices), STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) and STM324x9I-EVAL
    (STM32F429x/STM32F439x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any
    other supported device and development board.

	How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

	GPIO JTAG/SWD Remap example

	Example Description

This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG/SWD IOs as standard
GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence.

Note that once the JTAG/SWD IOs are disabled, the connection with the host debugger is
lost and cannot be re-established as long as the JTAG/SWD IOs remain disabled.
To avoid this situation, the Key push-button is used to disable or not the JTAG/SWD IOs:
 1. Key push-button maintained pressed at reset: JTAG/SWD IOs disabled and LED1 turned ON
 2. Key push-button not pressed at reset: JTAG/SWD IOs unchanged and LED2 turned ON

Before starting this example, you should disconnect your JTAG/SWD probe and run
the example in stand-alone mode.
