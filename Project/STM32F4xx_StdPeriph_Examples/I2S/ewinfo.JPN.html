	How to use the Audio features with I2S peripheral

	Example Description

This example provides basic implementation of audio features.
It allows to play an audio file through the I2S peripheral and using the external
codec implemented on the STM324xG_EVAL/STM324x7I_EVAL board.

In this example the I2S input clock, provided by a dedicated PLL (PLLI2S),  is
configured to have an audio sampling frequency at 48 KHz with Master clock enabled.

This example uses an audio codec driver which consists of three independent layers:
 - Codec Hardware layer: which controls and communicates with the audio codec
   (CS43L22) implemented on the evaluation board.
 - MAL (Media Access Layer): which controls and interfaces with storage media
   storing or providing the audio file/stream.
 - The high layer: which implements overall control and interfacing API allowing
   to perform basic audio operations (Init, Play, Pause, Resume, Stop, Volume
   control and audio file pointer management)

In this example the audio file is stored in the internal flash memory (Stereo,
16-bit, 48 KHz). The analog output device is automatically detected (Speaker or
Headphone) when the Headphone is plugged/unplugged in/from the audio jack of the
evaluation board. The example also manages information display and control interface
through push buttons:
 - When the application is Playing audio file:
     + Key   : Pause
     + Tamper: Volume UP
     + Wakeup: Volume DOWN
 - When the application is Paused:
     + Key   : Play
     + Tamper: Switch output target to Headphone
     + Wakeup: Switch output target to Speaker

This example plays the audio file stored in internal flash memory and replay it
when it reach end of file. But it can be tailored to used different media storage
devices; SDCard (through SDIO), external Memory (through FSMC) ...) or to play
in streaming mode (ie. from USB port in device or host mode). In this case, Circular
DMA mode should be preferred (by enabling the define AUDIO_MAL_MODE_CIRCULAR in
stm324xg_eval_audio_codec.h/stm324x7i_eval_audio_codec.h files).

	I2S communication example using polling mode

	Example Description

This example provides a small application to show how to configure the I2S for
full duplex communication, based on polling mode and through I2S firmware
library.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them
BoardA and BoardB) then connect these two boards through I2S lines and GND.
In the firmware example uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file to use
the I2S peripheral as STM32 Master device or as STM32 Slave device.

 note The connection between the pins should use a short wires and a common Ground.

- Software Description
In this Example, the I2S full duplex interface is based on the I2S2 peripheral with
an extra instance called I2S_ext used only for full duplex communication and can
operate only in Slave Mode.

Both I2Ss are configured as below:
  - Audio Frequency: 8 KHz
  - Standard: Phillips
  - MCLK Output: disabled
  - CPOL: Low
  - Data Format: 16b

In master board, I2S2 and I2S2_ext are enabled so I2S2 can deliver CK and WS to I2S2_ext.
The I2S2 peripheral is configured as Master Transmitter and I2S2_ext is configured
as Slave Receiver. Whereas in Slave Board, the I2S2 peripheral is configured as Slave
Receiver ans I2S2_ext is configured as Slave Transmitter.

- The Slave must be launched before the Master.
- The Master start the communication by sending aTxMasterBuffer buffer through SD pin
  in the same time he receive a buffer through ext_SD pin, which is stored in aRxMasterBuffer.
- The Slave Start the communication when the clock is already available on CK pin
  the Buffer received from master through SD pin,is stored in RxSlaveBuffer, in the
  same time the aTxSlaveBuffer buffer is transmitted through ext_SD pin.

- In Master Board, after the Communication end, if the received buffer is correct
  the LED2 and LED4  turns ON.
- In Slave Board, after the Communication end, if the received buffer is correct
  the LED 3 turns ON.

In both boards, the SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated
counter inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle LED1 each 100ms indicating that the
firmware is running.
