	Directory contents

 - project .ewd/.eww/.ewp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library
                           structure that produces an executable image with IAR
                           Embedded Workbench.

 - stm32f4xx_flash.icf : This file is the IAR Linker configuration file used to
                         place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH and data
                         (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal SRAM.
                         You can customize this file to your need.

 - stm32f4xx_flash_extsram.icf: This file is the IAR Linker configuration file
                                used to place program code (readonly) in internal
                                FLASH and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in
                                external SRAM. You can customize this file to your need.

 	How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
  - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
     - STM324xG_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F40xx/41xx devices.
      note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324xG_EVAL, STM32F40XX, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER

     - STM324x7I_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F427x/437x devices.
      note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324x7I_EVAL, STM32F427X, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER

     - STM324x9I_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F429x/439x devices.
      note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
           preprocessor section: USE_STM324x9I_EVAL, STM32F429X, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER

 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
